/*
Package orm provides an object-relational mapping layer with query
building, search, CRUD operations, and context management for object
persistence with permission scoping.

The [ORM] interface defines Get, Save, Update, Delete, Search, and Count
methods. Use [NewQuery] to build query clauses and [NewContext] to create
operation contexts with access control. The [ORMObjectBase] type provides
a base for ORM-managed entities with ID and timestamp fields.
